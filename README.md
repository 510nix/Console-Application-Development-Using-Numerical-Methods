# Console-Application-Development-Using-Numerical-Methods
This app provides methods for solving numerical problems, including linear equations (Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, Gauss/Gauss-Jordan elimination, LU factorization), non-linear equations (Bisection, False Position, Secant, Newton-Raphson), differential equations (Runge-Kutta), and matrix inversion.
